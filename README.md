 This software, written in R, and deployed as a Shiny application, is a fast and reliable solution to show some thematic data available at https://dati.arpae.it. It provides
      a simple and flexible solution to show data available as Google Sheets. It provides some examples of data manipulation (mainly to address problems like the decimal and thousand separator).
      Some info boxes are available as an example of what could be extracted from Google Sheets data and showed to users to make the information more exhaustive.
      The resulting data is displayed using the leaflet R package (https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and deployed as a Shiny application.
