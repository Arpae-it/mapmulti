    longDescription: |
      This software, written in R, and deployed as a Shiny application, is a fast and reliable solution to show some thematic data available at https://dati.arpae.it. It provides
      a simple and flexible solution to show data available as Google Sheet. It provides some examples of data manipulation (mainly to address problems like the decimal and thousand separator).
      The resulting data is displayed using the leaflet R package (https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).
